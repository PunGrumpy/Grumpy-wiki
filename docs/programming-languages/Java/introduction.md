## What Is Java?

Java is one of most widely used programming languages in the world!

Originally developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s, Java is used to develop everything from web applications to mobile applications to batch processing applications. Java started out as a pure object-oriented languages, but has now evolved into a multi-paradigm language that is highly adaptable to any situation. With a large developer community and support library, Java is ideal for developing almost any type of application

Java was originally developed by Jame Gosling (who is know as the father of the Java programming language) at Sun Microsystems (now acquired by Oracle) and release in 1995 as a core component of Sun's Java platform

Jame Gosling, Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton (Patrick Noston) initiated the Java programming language project in June 1991. The small team of Sun engineers call **Green Team**, project started in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive TV, but was too advanced for the digital cable TV industry at the time. The language was originally called **Oak** after an Oak tree outside Jame Gosling's office

## Java SE

**Java SE (Java Platform Standard Edition), formerly known as J2SE**, allows the development and deployment of java applications for use in desktop, server, embedded, and real-time environments. Java SE contains classes that support the development of Java Web service and provides the foundation for Java EE, such Java language foundation, JDBC operations, I/O operation, network communication, and technologies such as multithreading

## Features Of Java

### Inspired by C and C++

Java is inspired by C and C++. The syntax of Java is similar to these languages but the languages are quite different. Java inherits many features from C and C++. Compared to C++, Java code runs a bit slower but it is more portable and offers better security features.

### Simple And Familiar

Java programming language is simple to learn, understand, read, and write. Java programs are easy to create and implement compared to other programming languages such as C and C++. If you are familiar with the basic principles of programming or the concept of OOP (object-oriented programming), it would be easy to master Java.

### Object-Oriented

Java is fully object-oriented language, Unlike C++ which is semi object-oriented. It supports every OOP concept such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism. Java programs are developed using classes and objects. Another notable feature is that in Java the main() function is defined under a class

### Platform Independent

Java's platform independence means that Java programs complied on one machine or operating system can be executed on any other machine or operating system without modifications. It's also called an Architecture Neutral Language

Java supports WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere), which means that programmers can develop applications is one operation system and run on any other without any modifications

Java source code is complied using Java Complier. The complier converts the source code into an intermediate code called the byte code. This code is further converted into machine-dependent form by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). The JVM can execute byte code on any platform or operating system on which it's present

### Complied And Interpreted

Java offers both compilation and interpretation of programs. It combines the power of compiled languages and the flexibility of interpreted languages.

When a Java program is created, the Java compiler (javac) compiles the java source code into byte code. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) serves as an interpreter that converts byte code to machine code which is portable and can be executed on any operating system

### Multi-thread

Java supports multithreading programming. A thread is an independent process to execute a set of statements. The term multi-threaded refers to creating multiple threads to handle multiple tasks at the same time.

JVM uses multiple threads to execute different blocks of code of the same program in parallel. The multithreading feature allows programmers to write programs to do multiple tasks simultaneously. It improves CPU and main memory utilization as there is no need to wait for the application to finish one task before starting the other

### Dynamic

Java is more dynamic compared to C and C++. It can adapt to its evolving environment. It allows programmers to dynamically link new class libraries, objects, and methods. Java programs can have a large amount of run-time information that can be used to resolve accesses to objects

### Robust

Java is a robust language that can handle run-time errors as it checks the code during the compile and runtime. If any runtime error is identified by the JVM, it will not be passed directly to the underlying system. Instead, it will immediately terminate the program and stop it from causing any harm to the system. Java has a strong memory management system. It also supports the concepts of garbage collection and exception handling

### Secure

Java is a secure language that ensures that programs cannot gain access to memory locations without authorization. It has access modifiers to check memory access. Java also ensures that no viruses enter an applet. Javaâ€™s byte-code verifier checks the code blocks for any illegal code that violates the access right. It also does not allow programmers to explicitly create pointers

### High Performance

Java offers high performance as it used the JIT (Just In Time) compiler. The compiler only compiles that method which is being called. The JIT enhances the performance of interpreting byte code by caching interpretations

### Automatic Garbage Collection

The most common and critical problems in C/C++ were memory leaks. FYI, memory leaks are a problem wherein a piece of memory that is no longer in use, fails to be freed. This is because garbage collection has to be done manually. However, Java supports automatic Garbage collection. It keeps checking over such unused memory spaces and frees them automatically

### Conclusion

So, now we know what features make Java a popular and useful programming language among programmers, software developers, and data science professionals. It has a flexible design that enables developers to write code that can run on any machine. The impressive features of this versatile programming language enable programmers to create scalable and high-performance programs. We hope this article helped you understand what are the features of Java.

## Java Development

### JDK

JDK (Java Development Kit), called Java Development Kit or Java Development Tool, is a program development environment for writing Java Applets and applications. JDK is the core of the entire java, including the Java Runtime Environment (Java Runtime Environment), some Java tools and Java's core class library (Java API)

## JRE

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a runtime environment, and JRE is required to run Java programs. JDK contains JRE, so as long as JDK is installed, you can edit and run Java programs. If you just run ordinary java programs without installing JDK, you only need to install JRE
