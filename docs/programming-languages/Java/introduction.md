## What Is Java?

Java is one of most widely used programming languages in the world!

Originally developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s, Java is used to develop everything from web applications to mobile applications to batch processing applications. Java started out as a pure object-oriented languages, but has now evolved into a multi-paradigm language that is highly adaptable to any situation. With a large developer community and support library, Java is ideal for developing almost any type of application

Java was originally developed by Jame Gosling (who is know as the father of the Java programming language) at Sun Microsystems (now acquired by Oracle) and release in 1995 as a core component of Sun's Java platform

Jame Gosling, Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton (Patrick Noston) initiated the Java programming language project in June 1991. The small team of Sun engineers call **Green Team**, project started in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive TV, but was too advanced for the digital cable TV industry at the time. The language was originally called **Oak** after an Oak tree outside Jame Gosling's office

## Java SE

**Java SE (Java Platform Standard Edition), formerly known as J2SE**, allows the development and deployment of java applications for use in desktop, server, embedded, and real-time environments. Java SE contains classes that support the development of Java Web service and provides the foundation for Java EE, such Java language foundation, JDBC operations, I/O operation, network communication, and technologies such as multithreading

## Features Of Java

### Inspired by C and C++

Java is inspired by C and C++. The syntax of Java is similar to these languages but the languages are quite different. Java inherits many features from C and C++. Compared to C++, Java code runs a bit slower but it is more portable and offers better security features.

### Simple And Familiar

The style of the Java language is very similar to the C language and the C++ language. It's a pure object-oriented language. It inherits the object-oriented technical core of the C++ language, but abandons some of the shortcoming of C++, such as pointers that are easy ti cause errors and many Inheritance, etc., at the same time, a garbage collection mechanism is also added to release the unused memory space and solve the trouble of managing memory space

### Object-Oriented

Java is fully object-oriented language, Unlike C++ which is semi object-oriented. It supports every OOP concept such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism. Java programs are developed using classes and objects. Another notable feature is that in Java the main() function is defined under a class

### Platform Independent

Java's platform independence means that Java programs complied on one machine or operating system can be executed on any other machine or operating system without modifications. It's also called an Architecture Neutral Language

Java supports WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere), which means that programmers can develop applications is one operation system and run on any other without any modifications

Java source code is complied using Java Complier. The complier converts the source code into an intermediate code called the byte code. This code is further converted into machine-dependent form by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). The JVM can execute byte code on any platform or operating system on which it's present
