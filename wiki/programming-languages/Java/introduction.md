## What Is Java?

Java is one of most widely used programming languages in the world!

Originally developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s, Java is used to develop everything from web applications to mobile applications to batch processing applications. Java started out as a pure object-oriented languages, but has now evolved into a multi-paradigm language that is highly adaptable to any situation. With a large developer community and support library, Java is ideal for developing almost any type of application

Java was originally developed by Jame Gosling (who is know as the father of the Java programming language) at Sun Microsystems (now acquired by Oracle) and release in 1995 as a core component of Sun's Java platform

Jame Gosling, Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java programming language project in June 1991. The small team of Sun engineers call **Green Team**, project started in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive TV, but was too advanced for the digital cable TV industry at the time. The language was originally called **Oak** after an Oak tree outside Jame Gosling's office
